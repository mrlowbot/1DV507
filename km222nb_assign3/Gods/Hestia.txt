Virgin goddess of the hearth, home, and chastity. 
She is a daughter of Rhea and Cronus, and a sister of Zeus. 
Not often identifiable in Greek art, she appeared as a modestly veiled woman. 
Her symbols are the hearth and kettle. In some accounts, 
she gave up her seat as one of the Twelve Olympians in favor of Dionysus, 
and she plays little role in Greek myths. Her Roman counterpart Vesta, 
however, was a major deity of the Roman state.
