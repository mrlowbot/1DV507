God of war, bloodshed, and violence. 
The son of Zeus and Hera, he was depicted as a beardless youth, 
either nude with a helmet and spear or sword, or as an armed warrior. 
Homer portrays him as moody and unreliable, 
and as being the most unpopular god on earth and Olympus (Iliad 5.890–1). 
He generally represents the chaos of war in contrast to Athena, 
a goddess of military strategy and skill. Ares is known for cuckolding 
his brother Hephaestus, conducting an affair with his wife Aphrodite. 
His sacred animals include vultures, venomous snakes, dogs, and boars. 
His Roman counterpart Mars by contrast was regarded 
as the dignified ancestor of the Roman people.
