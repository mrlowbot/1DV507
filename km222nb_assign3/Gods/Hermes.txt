God of boundaries, travel, communication, trade, language, thieves and writing. 
Hermes was also responsible for protecting livestock and 
presided over the spheres associated with fertility, music, luck, 
and deception.[9] The son of Zeus and Maia, Hermes is the messenger of the gods, 
and a psychopomp who leads the souls of the dead into the afterlife. 
He was depicted either as a handsome and athletic beardless youth, 
or as an older bearded man. His attributes include the herald's wand or caduceus, 
winged sandals, and a traveler's cap. His sacred animals include the tortoise. 
His Roman counterpart is Mercury.
