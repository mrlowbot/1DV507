Queen of the gods, and goddess of marriage, women, childbirth, heirs, kings, and empires. 
She is the wife and sister of Zeus, and the daughter of Cronus and Rhea. 
She was usually depicted as a regal woman in the prime of her life, 
wearing a diadem and veil and holding a lotus-tipped staff. 
Although she is the goddess of marriage, Zeus's many infidelities 
drive her to jealousy and vengefulness. Her sacred animals include 
the heifer, the peacock, and the cuckoo. Her Roman counterpart is Juno.
